Academic data science (think of Donoho article)\\
\begin{itemize}
\item goes back to Tukey (1962)

\item it includes statistics and much more

Industrial data science (think of Provost and Fawcett)
\begin{itemize}
\item lots of engineering

\item certain kinds of problems---churn and pop-tarts---which are not as far from social science as they appear
\end{itemize}
