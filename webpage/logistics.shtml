    <h3 id="time">Time and location</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Class: Tuesday 2pm-5pm (TBA)</li>
      <li>Lab (optional): Thursday 2pm-5pm (TBA)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="prereqs">Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>There are no official prerequisites for the course, and students from all departments are welcome.  Activities involving mathematics, statistics, and computer programming at the level in Soc 500 and Soc 504 will be in a separate, optional lab session.  Students without this level of background may find some of the reading challenging.  The reading will also assume a basic understanding of the process of social science research (equivalent to Soc 503), and students without this background may find some of the reading challenging.  Undergraduates interested in taking the course should contact the instructor for permission.</p>

     <h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration policy</h3>
     <p>You are encouraged to work together on the activities for the class, but you are only only able to put your name on projects to which you made an intellectual contribution.  If you have any doubts about what is appropriate, ask me.</p>

     <h3 id="piazza">Piazza</h3>
     <p>In this course we will be using Piazza for online class discussion. You will not be required to post, but the system is designed to get you help quickly and efficiently from classmates and me. Rather than emailing me questions, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. Here is our class page: <a href="https://piazza.com/class/iss26a5trbl6zj">https://piazza.com/class/iss26a5trbl6zj</a>.</p>
