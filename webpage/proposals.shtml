    <h2>Proposals</h2>

    <h3 id="proposals">Proposal guidelines</h3>
    <p>Your proposal should clearly answer two questions: what you want to do and why we should care.  Please don't spend too much time on a literature review unless it is needed to understand what you want to do and why we should care.  This is a chance for you to get supportive, helpful feedback on early stage ideas so you should feel free to take some chances and be open about the weaknesses in your proposals.</p>

    <p>Each proposal is limited to 800 words.  As you will see, 800 words is quite short so use these words wisely.  You are encouraged to include figures and graphs to illustrate your ideas, and these do not count against your word limit.  All proposals must have clear titles.  Proposals must be submitted Sunday at midnight.</p>

    <h3 id="proposal-feedback">Proposal feedback guidelines</h3>
    <p>You will spend a lot of your career giving feedback on people's ideas.  This is an art, and this is your chance to practice that art.  The goal of your feedback is to be helpful to the author; it is not make yourself look smart.</p>

    <p>Proposal review must be done between Sunday at midnight (when the proposal is posted) and Monday at midnight.</p>

    <h3 id="proposal-feedback-feedback">Proposal feedback feedback guidelines</h3>
    <p>In order to help you learn more about how to give feedback, the author of the proposal will give you feedback on your feedback.  This will take the form of a simple 1 - 5 rating, as well as a description of anything that the author found particularly helpful.</p>
