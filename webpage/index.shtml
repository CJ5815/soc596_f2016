<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Changes in technology---specifically the transition from the analog age to the digital age---mean that we can now collect and analyze social data in new ways. This six week mini-class is about doing social research in these new ways.  Unlike some other courses on computational social science, this course will emphasize "social science" and de-emphasize "computation."  We will focus on how traditional concepts of research design in the social sciences can inform our understanding of new data sources, and how these new data sources might require us to update our thinking on research design.  The course should be helpful for social scientists that want to do more data science and data scientists that want to do more social science.</p>

<h4>Course goals and learning objectives</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Students will <em>describe</em> the opportunities and challenges that the digital age creates for social research.</li>
    <li>Students will <em>evaluate</em> modern social research from the perspectives of both social science and data science.</li>
    <li>Students will <em>create</em> modern research proposals that blend ideas from social science and data science.</li>
    <li>Students will <em>practice</em> the techniques needed to actually conduct their proposed research (optional).</li>
  </ol>

 <h4>Course activities</h4>
 <ul>
    <li><em>Collaborative annotation and feedback (x5)</em>:  During this course we will read a draft of my manuscript <a href="http://www.bitbybitbook.com">Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age</a>.  Whenever you read a chapter from this manuscript, there will be two assignments.  First, you will participate in a collaborative annotation of the document using <a href="https://hypothes.is/">hypothes.is</a>.  This annotation should be completed Sunday at midnight for material that we will discuss on Tuesday.  Second, you should post to Blackboard ideas about how each of the chapters should be improved.  This feedback should be completed by Monday at midnight for material that we will discuss on Tuesday.</li>

    <li><em>Shorter research proposal (x2)</em>: Between weeks 2 and 5, you will have to write 2 short research proposals.  These proposals are described in more detail in the <a href="proposals.shtml">research proposal guidelines</a>.  These proposals can be done in teams.</li>

    <li><em>Proposal review (x4)</em>: For weeks 2, 3, 4, and 5, you will write a review of the proposals of your peers. These proposal reviews are described in more detail in the <a href="proposals.shtml">research proposal review guidelines</a>.  The goal of your proposal review is to be as helpful as possible.</li>

   <li><em>Longer research proposal (x1)</em>: Building on your first two proposals, you will write be an extended research proposal, which could be an improved version of one your earlier research proposals.  This must be submitted Sunday, October 23 at midnight.  My hope is that the refined proposal will be completed by a team, and that this team will be interdisciplinary.  After you pitch your proposal in class on Tuesday, October 25, a final version of the proposal will be due Friday, October 28 at 5pm.</li>

   <li><em>Pitch (x1)</em>: During the class you will have a chance to pitch your shorter proposals, and you will be expected to do a longer, more formal pitch of your longer research proposal.  You will have 5 minutes to pitch your proposal in person on our last day of class.  Then, as a class, we will spend 10 minutes discussing the proposal and how it can be improved.</li>

   <li><em>Overall manuscript feedback (x1)</em>: After reading the entire manuscript and completing the class, you should send me a two-page review of the entire book manuscript.  This will be due Friday, October 28.</li>

   <li><em>Lab (x5) [Optional]</em>:For students that want to practice the techniques needed to discuss this research, we will have drop-in labs 5 times during the course of the semester.  At the lab, students will work together on a single problem.  This lab is optional, and is described in more detail on the <a href="labs.shtml">labs page</a>.</li>
 </ul>

<h4>Meeting structure</h4>
<p>Each class meeting will be split into four main parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Overview:</em> I’ll begin each class describing the main themes of the week.  This should be shorter than is typical in a graduate seminar because I’ve already described these themes in my manuscript.</li>
  <li><em>Case studies:</em> We will discuss a few case studies in detail that serve to illustrate some important themes of the week.</li>
  <li><em>Discussion of proposals:</em> Students will take turns presenting their proposals, and there will be a student-led discussion of the proposals.</li>
  <li><em>Preview:</em> At the end of class, I’ll preview some themes that you’ll encounter in the reading for next class.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, the class will be a mix of professor-led discussion and student-led discussion.  As the semester progresses, I will expect the students to take an increasingly active role in the course.</p>

<h2 id="intro_ethics">Introduction and Ethics <small>(September 20, 2016)</small></h2>

<p>In this first class we will cover a broad overview of computational social science, focusing on blending ideas from social science and data science.  A theme that runs throughout the course is ethics so we will cover it in the first week.</p>

<h2 id="big_data">Big data <small>(September 27, 2016)</small></h2>

<p>Human behavior in the digital age often leaves behind traces, and these traces are being aggregated by companies and governments on a massive scale.  This week we will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of using these big data sources for social research.  Then, I'll describe three approaches that can help you learn from these big data sources: counting things, forecasting, and approximating experiments.</p>

<h2 id="surveys">Surveys <small>(October 4, 2016)</small></h2>

<p>This week I'll begin by explaining that big data sources will not replace surveys.  In fact, the abundance of big data sources increases---not decreases---the value of surveys. Given that motivation, I’ll summarize the total survey error framework that was developed during the first two eras of survey research. This framework enables us to understand new approaches to representation (e.g., non-probability samples) and new approaches to measurement (e.g., new ways of asking questions to respondents). Finally, I’ll describe two research templates for linking survey data to big data sources.</p>

<h2 id="running_experiments">Running experiments <small>(October 11, 2016)</small></h2>

<p>Randomized controlled experiments have proven to be a powerful way to learn about the social world, and this week we will see how you can use them in your research.  We will describe the difference between lab experiments and field experiments and the differences between analog experiments and digital experiments. Further, I’ll argue that digital field experiments can offer the best features of analog lab experiments (tight control) and analog field experiments (realism), all at a scale that was not possible previously. Next, I’ll describe three concepts---validity, heterogeneity of treatment effects, and mechanisms---that are critical for designing rich experiments. With that background, I’ll describe the trade-offs involved in the two main strategies for conducting digital experiments: doing it yourself or partnering with the powerful. Finally, I’ll conclude with some design advice about how you can take advantage of the real power of digital experiments and describe some of responsibility that comes with that power.</p>

<h2 id="mass_collaboration">Mass collaborations <small>(October 18, 2016)</small></h2>

<p>Wikipedia is amazing. A mass collaboration of volunteers created a fantastic encyclopedia that is available to everyone. The key to Wikipedia’s success was not new knowledge; rather, it was a new form of collaboration. The digital age, fortunately, enables many new forms of collaboration. Thus, we should now ask: what massive scientific problems---problems that we could not solve individually---can we now tackle together?  Mass collaboration has a long, rich history in fields such as astronomy and ecology, but it is not yet common in social research. However, by describing successful projects from other fields and providing a few key organizing principles, I hope to convince you of two things. First, mass collaboration can be harnessed for social research. And, second, researchers who use mass collaboration will be able to solve problems that had previously seemed impossible. Although mass collaboration is often promoted as a way to save money, it is much more than that. As I will show, mass collaboration doesn’t just allow us to do research cheaper, it allows us to do research better.</p>
